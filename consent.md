## Introduction and Background Information
You are invited to participate in a research study. The study is being conducted by Prof. Patrick Shafto, PhD. The study is sponsored by the University of Louisville, Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences.

## Purpose
The purpose of this study is to understand how people learn and make guesses about the world. In particular, we are interested in how peoples' experiences and knowledge affect how they think and make predictions about the world.

## Procedures
In this study, you will be asked to answer a series of questions. These questions will ask what you think about different scenarios or sets of objects. There are no right or wrong answers. You may decline to answer any questions that make you uncomfortable. Depending on the number of questions, the study should take between 1 and 30 minutes to complete.

## Potential Risks
The only risks are those inherent in using a computer for 30 minutes at a reasonable level of intensity. These may include, but are not limited to issues such as wrist pain and muscle fatigue. Although unlikely, there may be unforeseen risks.

## Benefits
The possible benefits of this study include improved computer-based methods for finding structure in data, improved understanding of human reasoning in real-world settings, and/or improved computer-based training methods.

## Compensation
You will receive monetary compensation for participating in this experiment at the rate detailed when you chose this job.

## Confidentiality
Total privacy cannot be guaranteed. Individuals from the Department of Brain and Psychological Sciences, the Institutional Review Board (IRB), the Human Subjects Protection Program Office (HSPPO), and other regulatory agencies may inspect these records. Your privacy will be protected to the extent permitted by law. If the results from this study are published, your name will not be made public. The resulting data will not contain identifying information; your data will be assigned a random number that will not be tied to your name.
